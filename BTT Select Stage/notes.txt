CSS load notes
-0x49E0 = pointer to a jobj from MnSlChr.usd. the jobj pointed to depends on
the max allowed players for the CSS type.

-0x49AB = max allowed players for the CSS type.

-there are a ton of conditionals throughout CSS_LoadFunction that check the max players
to determine which jobj pointer exists at -0x49E0. apparently a lot of UI elements
are exclusive to the jobj at this pointer. it is referenced in most every CSS
function, onload and per frame.
